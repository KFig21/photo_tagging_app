# Photo Tagging App (Where's Waldo?)


- <a href="https://kfig21.github.io/photo_tagging_app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View the project here!</a>
- Made for The Odin Project curriculum
- React based application
- Utilized Firebase-firestore for a back end database

<h3> Things I'm proud of: </h3>

- Global Leaderboard for 8 unique levels that updates in realtime
- Use of firebase-firestore for a live back end database
- Explitive usernames submitted to the leaderboard are censored
- The overall design aesthetic
- Using hooks rather than variables to store/update information

<h3> Things I need guidance with: </h3>

- Creating custom hooks to better implement my variables
- Using libraries like Material UI or Tailwind so I dont spend so much time working on a CSS file
